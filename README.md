The files included in this milestone are: 
DEQ.h, Airport.h, Airplane.h, "UML Class Diagram.docx"


Please also note that since the UML diagram is not supposed to include the main function, the part of the project that we decided to implement in the main program (which handles the arrival and processing) is not included in this submission (also because it does not have a header file). 

How to use the program

First input the sim duration

Pick real time by Y, else enter any character
